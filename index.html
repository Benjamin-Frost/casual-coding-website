      This is a scratch project that (very slowly) draws the Mandelbrot set.
      Click the green flag to start. By clicking on the green flag again with
      the shift button pressed will enable Turbo Mode. You might want that,
      because without it the cat is so slow, it might as well invoke 7
      compilation steps to calculate each pixel. Use the feature at your own
      discretion.
